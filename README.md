# PythonBETAChatBot
This is a chatbot written in Python 3
## How it works
First the input is converted to a list of words. The Program finds the subject and the verb of the question and the "type" of the question ( explain, place, time, commnad, etc.). Then it makes a sentence by the next structure: "subject + verb + preposition + concrete answer" (the last one is still in beta...). The chatBot finds the preposition using the question_type.

## Example
why birds fly?<br>
birds fly because BETA
