# PythonBETAChatBot
This is a chatbot written in Python 3
## How it works
First the input is converted to a list of words. The Program finds the subject and the verb of the question and the "type" of the question ( explain, place, time, commnad, etc.). Then it makes a sentence by the next structure: "subject + verb + preposition + concrete answer(memorized to brain)". The chatBot finds the preposition using the question_type.

## Example
humans like to read because they like it.<br>
H u m a n s r e a d b e c a u s e   t h e y   l i k e   i t . (writing it to brain)
<br><br>
why humans read?<br>
humans read because :  they like it.
